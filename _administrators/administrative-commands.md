# Materia's CLI Management Commands

Materia CLI commands are executed using FuelPhp's **[Oil Utility](https://fuelphp.com/docs/packages/oil/intro.html)**. Oil is a script that resides in the **root directory of Materia**, so all oil commands should be run from there.


## Executing a Materia Task

```shell
$ php oil refine widget:show_engines
```

To break that down:

* `php` is the PHP executable
* `oil` is a FuelPHP [command line utility](https://fuelphp.com/docs/packages/oil/intro.html)
* `refine` is an Oil [utility for running tasks](https://fuelphp.com/docs/packages/oil/refine.html)
* `widget` is the [Widget Task Class](https://github.com/ucfopen/Materia/blob/master/fuel/app/tasks/widget.php) to use
* `show_engines` is the method task from [Admin Task Class](https://github.com/ucfopen/Materia/blob/master/fuel/app/tasks/admin.php)


> You'll likely need to juggle which **FuelPHP environment** your commands run in as it dictates which configuration settings are loaded. Typically you'll just set them inline, for example: `$ FUEL_ENV=production php oil refine admin:show_engines`, but they can be set in a more persistent way.

## Listing Task Class Commands

A list of each task class can be seen by that task with no method argument.

```shell
$ php oil refine admin

available commands:
setup_migrations
destroy_everything
destroy_widgets
destroy_database
populate
populate_semesters
populate_roles
give_user_role
new_user
clear_cache
import_sql
anonymize_users
change_db_prefix
```

### Initial Materia Install Task

The `php oil refine install` task is meant to be used on a newly installed Materia server. It will go through the process of asking for various configuration settings and making sure all the files and directories are set up as needed.
